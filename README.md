Over 5000 lives are taken daily because of
illnesses related to pollution and continues to be an
important issue worldwide. Air pollution is considered a
major problem in some cities such as Dammam, Lahore,
Delhi. This study uses machine learning techniques, with a
focus on ARIMAX, Auto-ARIMA, SARIMAX to predict
air pollution using advances in information and computing
technology. The datasets used here contain daily pollutant
data such as Particle matter 2.5 (PM2.5), Particle Matter
10(PM10), Ozone 3(O3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur
Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) for predicting
the air quality predictions of overall India and a particular
city. During data analysis the dataset showed a clear
seasonality and trend during some months. Assuming
evaluating models like ARIMA, Auto-ARIMA,
SARIMAX, the project concluded that SARIMAX is the
best model. Statistical calculations like Root mean square
error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to
check the SARIMAXâ€™S prediction accuracy. Beyond AQI
prediction, the group introduced an additional assignment
that examines the possible impacts of pollution when an
industry, power plants and factory is established in a
particular city or all over India. The study promises to
provide a complete understanding about the environmental
and health effects by increasing the scope to include the
effects of industries. Using the user-friendly Tkinter
